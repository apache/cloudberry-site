# DROP USER MAPPING

Removes a user mapping for a foreign server.

## Synopsis

```sql
DROP USER MAPPING [ IF EXISTS ] { <user_name> | USER | CURRENT_USER | PUBLIC } 
    SERVER <server_name>
```

## Description

`DROP USER MAPPING` removes an existing user mapping from a foreign server.

The owner of a foreign server can drop user mappings for that server for any user. Also, a user can drop a user mapping for their own user name if they have been granted the `USAGE` privilege on the server.

## Parameters

**`IF EXISTS`**

Do not throw an error if the user mapping does not exist. Cloudberry Database issues a notice in this case.

**`user_name`**

User name of the mapping. `CURRENT_USER` and `USER` match the name of the current user. `PUBLIC` is used to match all present and future user names in the system.

**`server_name`**

Server name of the user mapping.

## Examples

Drop the user mapping named `bob`, server `foo` if it exists:

```sql
DROP USER MAPPING IF EXISTS FOR bob SERVER foo;
```

## Compatibility

`DROP SERVER` conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED). The `IF EXISTS` clause is a Cloudberry Database extension.
