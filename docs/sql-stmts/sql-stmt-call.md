# CALL

Invokes a procedure.

## Synopsis

```sql
CALL <name> ( [ <argument> ] [, ...] )
```

## Description

`CALL` executes a procedure.

If the procedure has any output parameters, then a result row will be returned, containing the values of those parameters.

## Parameters

**`name`**

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the procedure.

**`argument`**

An input argument for the procedure call.

## Notes

The user must have `EXECUTE` privilege on the procedure in order to be allowed to invoke it.

To call a function (not a procedure), use [SELECT](/docs/sql-stmts/sql-stmt-select.md) instead.

If `CALL` is invoked in a transaction block, then the called procedure cannot run transaction control statements. Transaction control statements are only allowed if `CALL` is invoked in its own transaction.

PL/pgSQL handles output parameters in `CALL` commands differently; refer to [Calling a Procedure](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/plpgsql-control-structures.html#PLPGSQL-STATEMENTS-CALLING-PROCEDURE) in the PostgreSQL documentation for more information.

## Examples

```sql
CALL do_db_maintenance();
```

## Compatibility

`CALL` conforms to the SQL standard.
