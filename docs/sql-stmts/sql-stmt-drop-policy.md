# DROP POLICY

Removes a row-level security policy from a table.

## Synopsis

```sql
DROP POLICY [ IF EXISTS ] <name> ON <table_name> [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP POLICY` removes the specified policy from the table. Note that if the last policy is removed for a table and the table still has row-level security enabled via `ALTER TABLE`, then the default-deny policy will be used. `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` can be used to disable row-level security for a table, whether policies for the table exist or not.

## Parameters

**`IF EXISTS`**

Do not throw an error if the policy does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

**`name`**

The name of the policy to drop.

**`table_name`**

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table that the policy is on.

CASCADE
**`RESTRICT`**

These key words have no effect, since there are no dependencies on policies.

## Examples

To drop the policy called `p1` on the table named `my_table`:

```sql
DROP POLICY p1 ON my_table;
```

## Compatibility

`DROP POLICY` is a Cloudberry Database extension to the SQL standard.
