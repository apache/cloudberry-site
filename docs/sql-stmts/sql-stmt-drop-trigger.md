# DROP TRIGGER

Removes a trigger.

## Synopsis

```sql
DROP TRIGGER [IF EXISTS] <name> ON <table> [CASCADE | RESTRICT]
```

## Description

`DROP TRIGGER` will remove an existing trigger definition. To run this command, the current user must be the owner of the table for which the trigger is defined.

## Parameters

**`IF EXISTS`**

Do not throw an error if the trigger does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

**`name`**

The name of the trigger to remove.

**`table`**

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table for which the trigger is defined.

**`CASCADE`**

Automatically drop objects that depend on the trigger.

**`RESTRICT`**

Refuse to drop the trigger if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

Remove the trigger `sendmail` on table `expenses`;

```sql
DROP TRIGGER sendmail ON expenses;
```

## Compatibility

The `DROP TRIGGER` statement in Cloudberry Database is not compatible with the SQL standard. In the SQL standard, trigger names are not local to tables, so the command is simply `DROP TRIGGER name`.
