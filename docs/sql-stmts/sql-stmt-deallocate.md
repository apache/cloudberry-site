# DEALLOCATE

Deallocates a prepared statement.

## Synopsis

```sql
DEALLOCATE [PREPARE] { <name> | ALL }
```

## Description

`DEALLOCATE` is used to deallocate a previously prepared SQL statement. If you do not explicitly deallocate a prepared statement, it is deallocated when the session ends.

For more information on prepared statements, see [PREPARE](/docs/sql-stmts/sql-stmt-prepare.md).

## Parameters

**`PREPARE`**

Optional key word which is ignored.

**`name`**

The name of the prepared statement to deallocate.

**`ALL`**

Deallocate all prepared statements

## Examples

Deallocate the previously prepared statement named `insert_names`:

```sql
DEALLOCATE insert_names;
```

## Compatibility

The SQL standard includes a `DEALLOCATE` statement, but it is only for use in embedded SQL.
