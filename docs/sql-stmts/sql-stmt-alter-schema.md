# ALTER SCHEMA

Changes the definition of a schema.

## Synopsis

```sql
ALTER SCHEMA <name> RENAME TO <new_name>

ALTER SCHEMA <name> OWNER TO { <new_owner> | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
```

## Description

`ALTER SCHEMA` changes the definition of a schema.

You must own the schema to use `ALTER SCHEMA`. To rename a schema you must also have the `CREATE` privilege for the database. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role, and you must have the `CREATE` privilege for the database. Note that superusers have all these privileges automatically.

## Parameters

**`name`**

The name of an existing schema.

**`new_name`**

The new name of the schema. The new name cannot begin with `pg_`, as such names are reserved for system schemas.

**`new_owner`**

The new owner of the schema.

## Compatibility

There is no `ALTER SCHEMA` statement in the SQL standard.
