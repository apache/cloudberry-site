## Description

`CREATE USER` is an alias for [CREATE ROLE](/docs/sql-stmts/sql-stmt-create-role.md). The only difference is that when the command `CREATE USER` is invoked, `LOGIN` is assumed by default, whereas `NOLOGIN` is assumed when the command invoked is `CREATE ROLE`.

## Compatibility

The `CREATE USER` statement is a Cloudberry Database extension. The SQL standard leaves the definition of users to the implementation.
