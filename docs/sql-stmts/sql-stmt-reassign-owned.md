# REASSIGN OWNED

Changes the ownership of database objects owned by a database role.

## Synopsis

```sql
REASSIGN OWNED BY { <old_role> | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER } [, ...]
               TO { <new_role> | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
```

## Description

`REASSIGN OWNED` changes the ownership of database objects owned by any of the old_roles to new_role.

## Parameters

**`old_role`**

The name of a role. The ownership of all the objects in the current database, and of all shared objects (databases, tablespaces), owned by this role will be reassigned to new_role.

**`new_role`**

The name of the role that will be made the new owner of the affected objects.

## Notes

`REASSIGN OWNED` is often used to prepare for the removal of one or more roles. Because `REASSIGN OWNED` does not affect objects in other databases, it is usually necessary to run this command in each database that contains objects owned by a role that is to be removed.

`REASSIGN OWNED` requires privileges on both the source role(s) and the target role.

The [DROP OWNED](/docs/sql-stmts/sql-stmt-drop-owned.md) command is an alternative that simply drops all of the database objects owned by one or more roles.

The `REASSIGN OWNED` command does not affect any privileges granted to the old_roles on objects that are not owned by them. Likewise, it does not affect default privileges created with `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`. Use `DROP OWNED` to revoke such privileges.

## Examples

Reassign any database objects owned by the role named `sally` and `bob` to `admin`:

```sql
REASSIGN OWNED BY sally, bob TO admin;
```

## Compatibility

The `REASSIGN OWNED` command is a Cloudberry Database extension.
