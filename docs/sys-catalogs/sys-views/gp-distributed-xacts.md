# gp_distributed_xacts

The `gp_distributed_xacts` view contains information about Apache Cloudberry distributed transactions. A distributed transaction is a transaction that involves modifying data on the segment instances. Apache Cloudberry's distributed transaction manager ensures that the segments stay in synch. This view allows you to see the currently active sessions and their associated distributed transactions.
