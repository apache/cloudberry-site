# Utility Overview

The command-line utilities provided with Cloudberry Database.

Cloudberry Database uses the standard PostgreSQL client and server programs and provides additional management utilities for administering a distributed Cloudberry Database DBMS.

Several utilities are installed when you install the Cloudberry Database server. These utilities reside in `$GPHOME/bin`.

Superscripts identify those utilities that require separate downloads, as well as those utilities that are also installed with the Client and Loader Tools Packages. All utilities are installed when you install the Cloudberry Database server, unless specifically identified by a superscript.

For more information about a utility, see the corresponding topic listed in the System Utilities section.
