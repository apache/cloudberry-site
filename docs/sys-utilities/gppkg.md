# gppkg

Cloudberry Package Manager installs, upgrades, migrates, and removes Cloudberry Database extensions in `.gppkg` format, such as PL/Java, PL/R, PostGIS, and MADlib, along with their dependencies, across an entire cluster.

## Synopsis

```shell
gppkg <command> [<command_options> ...] 

gppkg <commmand> --h | --help

gppkg --version

gppkg -v | --verbose
```

## Description

The Cloudberry Package Manager -- `gppkg` -- utility installs Cloudberry Database extensions, along with any dependencies, on all hosts across a cluster. It will also automatically install extensions on new hosts in the case of system expansion and segment recovery.

The `gppkg` utility does not require that Cloudberry Database is running in order to install packages.

Examples of database extensions and packages software that are delivered using the Cloudberry Package Manager:

- PL/Java
- PL/R
- PostGIS
- MADlib

## Commands

**`help`**

Display the help for the command.

**`install <package_name> [<command_options>]`**

Install or upgrade the specified package in the cluster. This includes any pre/post installation steps and installation of any dependencies.

**`migrate --source <source_path> --destination <destination_path> [--pkglibs <pkglibs_path>] [<command_options>]`**

Migrate all packages from one minor version of Cloudberry Database to another. The option `--source <source_path>` specifies the path of the source `$GPHOME`, and the option `--destination <destination_path>` specifies the path of the destination `$GPHOME`. Additionally, the option `--pkglibs <pkglibs_path>` allows you to point to a location where you may place newer version packages for the destination Cloudberry version; `gppkg` will upgrade these packages automatically. 

**`query [<package_name_string>] [<query_option>] [<command_options>]`**

Display information about the extensions installed in the cluster. `<package_name_string>` is a string that specifies the package name. If it is an empty string, it will match all packages. If it is a simple word, it will match all packages with the word included in the name. Use `â€“-exact` to specify the exact package name.

|query_option|Returns|
|-------------|-------|
|`--exact`|The provided `<package_name_string>` must match exactly a package name|
|`--detail`|Provide detailed information about the package|
|`--verify`|Verify the package installation|
|`--local`|Do not query at cluster level|

**`remove <package_name> [<command_options>]`**

Uninstall the specified package from the cluster. 

**`sync [<command_options>]`**

Reconcile the package state of the cluster to match the state of the master host. Running this option after a failed or partial install/uninstall ensures that the package installation state is consistent across the cluster.

## Global options

**`--cluster_info <cluster_info>`**

Use this option when Cloudberry Database is not running. The input file `<cluster_info>` contains information about the database cluster. You may generate the file by running the following command:

```shell
psql postgres -Xc 'select dbid, content, role, preferred_role, mode, status, hostname, address, port, datadir from gp_segment_configuration order by content, preferred_role desc;' | head -n-2 | tail -n+3 | tr -d " " > cluster_info
```

**`-a | --accept`**

Do not prompt the user for confirmation.

**`-d | --dryrun`**

Run a simulation for the command, without modifying anything.

**`-f | --force`**

Skip all requirement checks and overwrite existing files.

**`-h | --help`**

Display the online help.

**`-V | --version`**

Display the version of this utility.

**`-v | --verbose`**

Set the logging level to verbose.

## Examples

Install the Cloudberry Database PL/Java extension:

```shell
gppkg install ./pljava-2.0.7-gp7-rhel8_x86_64.gppkg
```

Query all packages that are installed in a cluster:

```shell
gppkg query
