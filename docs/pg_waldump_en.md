# pg_waldump in Apache Cloudberry

Apache Cloudberry offers a robust mechanism for inspecting Write-Ahead Log (WAL) files, aiding users in analyzing database changes, tracking operations, and diagnosing issues. The `pg_waldump` functionality in Cloudberry emulates the `pg_waldump` utility found in PostgreSQL, with enhancements tailored for Cloudberry's distributed architecture.

## Features

- **WAL Analysis**: The `pg_waldump` function in Cloudberry allows users to parse and decode WAL files, presenting a human-readable format of the log data.
- **Multi-Node Support**: Unlike PostgreSQL's single-node setup, Cloudberry's `pg_waldump` supports analyzing WAL logs across distributed nodes, making it suitable for distributed databases.
- **Customizable Output**: The output format can be adjusted based on user preferences, including the level of detail and specific data points to be logged.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Cloudberry enhances `pg_waldump` with real-time monitoring capabilities, allowing users to track WAL activities as they occur.
- **Error Diagnosis**: The tool assists in identifying errors or anomalies within the WAL entries, aiding in troubleshooting issues related to database integrity and replication.

## Usage

1. **Access pg_waldump**: Connect to the Cloudberry instance using the command-line interface (CLI).
2. **Run the Command**: Execute the `pg_waldump` command with the appropriate options to start analyzing the WAL logs. A basic example is:
   ```bash
   pg_waldump --nodes=node1,node2 --format=human --level=high

## Options

Here are some common options for `pg_waldump`:

- `-f, --format`: Output format (e.g., plain text, JSON).
- `-p, --pagesize`: Set the WAL page size.
- `-c, --cluster`: Analyze a specific PostgreSQL cluster.
- `-l, --list`: List available WAL segments.
- `-s, --start`: Start point of WAL decoding.
- `-e, --end`: End point of WAL decoding.
