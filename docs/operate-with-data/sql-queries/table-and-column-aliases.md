# Table and Column Aliases

A temporary name can be given to tables and complex table references to be used for references to the derived table in the rest of the query. This is called a table alias.

To create a table alias, write:

```sql
FROM table_reference AS alias
```

or

```sql
FROM table_reference alias
```

The `AS` key word is optional noise. `alias` can be any identifier.

A typical application of table aliases is to assign short identifiers to long table names to keep the join clauses readable. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM some_very_long_table_name s JOIN another_fairly_long_name a ON s.id = a.num;
```

The alias becomes the new name of the table reference so far as the current query is concerned â€” it is not allowed to refer to the table by the original name elsewhere in the query. Thus, this is not valid:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table AS m WHERE my_table.a > 5;    -- wrong
```

Table aliases are mainly for notational convenience, but it is necessary to use them when joining a table to itself. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM people AS mother JOIN people AS child ON mother.id = child.mother_id;
```

In addition, an alias is required if the table reference is a subquery.

Parentheses are used to resolve ambiguities. In the following example, the first statement assigns the alias b to the second instance of `my_table`, but the second statement assigns the alias to the result of the join:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table AS a CROSS JOIN my_table AS b ...
SELECT * FROM (my_table AS a CROSS JOIN my_table) AS b ...
```

Another form of table aliasing gives temporary names to the columns of the table, as well as the table itself:

```sql
FROM table_reference [AS] alias ( column1 [, column2 [, ...]] )
```

If fewer column aliases are specified than the actual table has columns, the remaining columns are not renamed. This syntax is especially useful for self-joins or subqueries.

When an alias is applied to the output of a `JOIN` clause, the alias hides the original name(s) within the `JOIN`. For example:

```sql
SELECT a.* FROM my_table AS a JOIN your_table AS b ON ...
```

is valid SQL, but:

```sql
SELECT a.* FROM (my_table AS a JOIN your_table AS b ON ...) AS c
```

is not valid; the table alias a is not visible outside the alias `c`.
