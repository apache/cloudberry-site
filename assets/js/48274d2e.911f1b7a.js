At times, it is necessary to increase database capacity to consolidate different data warehouses into a single database. Additional computing capacity (CPU) may also be needed to accommodate newly added analytics projects.

Unlike data warehouse systems that require substantial downtime in order to dump and restore the data, expanding a Apache Cloudberry system is a phased process with minimal downtime. Regular and ad hoc workloads can continue while data is redistributed and transactional consistency is maintained. The administrator can schedule the distribution activity to fit into ongoing operations and can pause and resume as needed. Tables can be ranked so that datasets are redistributed in a prioritized sequence, either to ensure that critical workloads benefit from the expanded capacity sooner, or to free disk space needed to redistribute very large tables."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(s.p,{children:"The expansion process uses standard Apache Cloudberry operations so it is transparent and easy for administrators to troubleshoot.
