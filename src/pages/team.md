The Apache Cloudberry (Incubating) team works on developing the core database kernel, utilities, tools, as well as the documentation website. 

## Podling PMC
Each Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC) helps its Podling learn how to govern itself. It works like a PMC but reports to the Incubator PMC instead of to the ASF Board. Initially, it is composed of the Podlingâ€™s mentors and the initial committers. The PPMC is directly responsible for the oversight of the podling, and it also decides who to add as a PPMC member.

Our journey began in 2022, and we have built our foundation on PostgreSQL and Greenplum Database. We would not be where we are today without the invaluable contributions of the two project contributors. We extend our heartfelt thanks to them.
