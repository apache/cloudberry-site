The Cloudberry Database team works on developing the core database kernel, utilities, tools, as well as the documentation website. Our journey began in 2022, and we have built our foundation on PostgreSQL and Greenplum Database. We would not be where we are today without the invaluable contributions of the two project contributors. We extend our heartfelt thanks to them.
