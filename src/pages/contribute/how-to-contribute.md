## Benefits of Contribution

There are many reasons to contribute to Apache Cloudberry and open
source projects in general. Here are some of the benefits of
participating:

- Growing your network. Working with Apache Cloudberry in open
  source can help connect you with people working on similar things. You
  can get help or give help, and you might even make a real-life
  acquaintance!

- Improving your skills. When you work on a Apache Cloudberry issue
  or Pull Request, inevitably you'll learn more about how something
  works in our project; either by asking questions and gathering info or
  by digging deeper into the code yourself. There’s a skill-building
  benefit to contributing to open source projects.

- Becoming an expert. You might start new to a project like Cloudberry
  Database or PostgreSQL, and by building things and opening issues when
  you encounter a new challenge or a bug, you’ll learn a ton over
  time. You could find your knowledge of said project has grown so much
  that you’ve become an expert.

- Speaking at conferences or more community events. With those skills
  you’ve earned yourself working in open source, you can let other
  people hear from you, and build your professional reputation through
  these community activities.

- Getting free swag! By participating in GitHub and other community
  channels, you can become eligible for free swag that the Cloudberry
  Database team offers as a way to say thank you.

There are undoubtedly more benefits than those listed here. Hope you
enjoy your contribution to the Apache Cloudberry community!
