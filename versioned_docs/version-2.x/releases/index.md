# Releases

**Note:**

We are currently preparing for the release under the Apache Incubator. Previous versions were non-Apache releases. If you want to install Apache Cloudberry, you can either:

* **Manually build Cloudberry from the main branch**: This approach is suitable for developers or users who want to experience the latest features. You can clone the repository and follow the build instructions provided in the documentation.
* **Install the non-Apache release: [v1.6.0](https://github.com/apache/cloudberry/releases/tag/1.6.0)**: This version is stable and ready for production use, offering the rpm packages for both Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 version.
