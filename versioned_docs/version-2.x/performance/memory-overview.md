# Memory Overview

Memory is a key resource for a Apache Cloudberry system and, when used efficiently, can ensure high performance and throughput. This topic describes how segment host memory is allocated between segments and the options available to administrators to configure memory.

A Apache Cloudberry segment host runs multiple PostgreSQL instances, all sharing the host's memory. The segments have an identical configuration and they consume similar amounts of memory, CPU, and disk IO simultaneously, while working on queries in parallel.

For best query throughput, the memory configuration should be managed carefully. There are memory configuration options at every level in Apache Cloudberry, from operating system parameters, to managing resources with resource queues and resource groups, to setting the amount of memory allocated to an individual query.

## Segment host memory overview

On a Apache Cloudberry segment host, the available host memory is shared among all the processes running on the computer, including the operating system, Apache Cloudberry segment instances, and other application processes. Administrators must determine what Apache Cloudberry and non-Apache Cloudberry processes share the hosts' memory and configure the system to use the memory efficiently. It is equally important to monitor memory usage regularly to detect any changes in the way host memory is consumed by Apache Cloudberry or other processes.

The following figure illustrates how memory is consumed on a Apache Cloudberry segment host when resource queue-based resource management is active.

Beginning at the bottom of the illustration, the line labeled `A` represents the total host memory. The line directly above line `A` shows that the total host memory comprises both physical RAM and swap space.

The line labelled `B` shows that the total memory available must be shared by Apache Cloudberry and all other processes on the host. Non-Apache Cloudberry processes include the operating system and any other applications, for example system monitoring agents. Some applications may use a significant portion of memory and, as a result, you may have to adjust the number of segments per Apache Cloudberry host or the amount of memory per segment.

Each segment on line labelled `C` gets an equal share of the Apache Cloudberry memory.

Within a segment, the currently active resource management scheme, resource queues or resource groups, governs how memory is allocated to run a SQL statement. These constructs allow you to translate business requirements into execution policies in your Apache Cloudberry system and to guard against queries that could degrade performance. For an overview of resource groups and resource queues, refer to [Managing Resources](./manage-resources.md).

## Configure segment host memory

Host memory is the total memory shared by all applications on the segment host. You can configure the amount of host memory using any of the following methods:

- Add more RAM to the nodes to increase the physical memory.
- Allocate swap space to increase the size of virtual memory.
- Adjust the kernel parameter `vm.overcommit_ratio` to configure how the operating system handles large memory allocation requests.

The physical RAM and OS configuration are usually managed by the platform team and system administrators. See the [Software and Hardware Requirements](../cbdb-op-software-hardware.md) for the recommended kernel parameters and for how to set the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file parameters.

The amount of memory to reserve for the operating system and other processes is workload dependent. The minimum recommendation for operating system memory is 32GB, but if there is much concurrency in Apache Cloudberry, increasing to 64GB of reserved memory may be required. The largest user of operating system memory is SLAB, which increases as Apache Cloudberry concurrency and the number of sockets used increases.

The `vm.overcommit_memory` kernel parameter should always be set to 2, the only safe value for Apache Cloudberry.

The `vm.overcommit_ratio` kernel parameter sets the percentage of RAM that is used for application processes, the remainder reserved for the operating system. The default for Red Hat is 50 \(50%\). Setting this parameter too high may result in insufficient memory reserved for the operating system, which can cause segment host failure or database failure. Leaving the setting at the default of 50 is generally safe, but conservative. Setting the value too low reduces the amount of concurrency and the complexity of queries you can run at the same time by reducing the amount of memory available to Apache Cloudberry. When increasing `vm.overcommit_ratio`, it is important to remember to always reserve some memory for operating system activities.

To calculate a safe value for `vm.overcommit_ratio`, first determine the total memory available to Apache Cloudberry processes, `gp_vmem`.

- If the total system memory is less than 256 GB, use this formula:

    ```shell
    gp_vmem = ((SWAP + RAM) – (7.5GB + 0.05 * RAM)) / 1.7
    ```

- If the total system memory is equal to or greater than 256 GB, use this formula:

    ```shell
    gp_vmem = ((SWAP + RAM) – (7.5GB + 0.05 * RAM)) / 1.17
    ```

where `SWAP` is the swap space on the host in GB, and `RAM` is the number of GB of RAM installed on the host.

Use `gp_vmem` to calculate the `vm.overcommit_ratio` value with this formula:

```sql
vm.overcommit_ratio = (RAM - 0.026 * gp_vmem) / RAM
```

## Configure Apache Cloudberry memory

Apache Cloudberry Memory is the amount of memory available to all Apache Cloudberry segment instances.

When you set up the Apache Cloudberry cluster, you determine the number of primary segments to run per host and the amount of memory to allocate for each segment. Depending on the CPU cores, amount of physical RAM, and workload characteristics, the number of segments is usually a value between 4 and 8. With segment mirroring enabled, it is important to allocate memory for the maximum number of primary segments running on a host during a failure. For example, if you use the default grouping mirror configuration, a segment host failure doubles the number of acting primaries on the host that has the failed host's mirrors. Mirror configurations that spread each host's mirrors over multiple other hosts can lower the maximum, allowing more memory to be allocated for each segment. For example, if you use a block mirroring configuration with 4 hosts per block and 8 primary segments per host, a single host failure would cause other hosts in the block to have a maximum of 11 active primaries, compared to 16 for the default grouping mirror configuration.

The `gp_vmem_protect_limit` server configuration parameter value identifies the amount of memory to allocate to each segment. This value is estimated by calculating the memory available for all Apache Cloudberry processes and dividing by the maximum number of primary segments during a failure. If `gp_vmem_protect_limit` is set too high, queries can fail. Use the following formula to calculate a safe value for `gp_vmem_protect_limit`, using the `gp_vmem` value that you calculated earlier.

```shell
gp_vmem_protect_limit = gp_vmem / max_acting_primary_segments
```

where `max_acting_primary_segments` is the maximum number of primary segments that could be running on a host when mirror segments are activated due to a host or segment failure.

Resource queues and resource groups expose additional configuration parameters that enable you to further control and refine the amount of memory allocated for queries.

## Example memory configuration calculations

This section provides example memory calculations for resource queues and resource groups for a Apache Cloudberry system with the following specifications:

- Total RAM = 256GB
- Swap = 64GB
- 8 primary segments and 8 mirror segments per host, in blocks of 4 hosts
- Maximum number of primaries per host during failure is 11

The `vm.overcommit_ratio` calculation for this example system follows:

```shell
gp_vmem = ((SWAP + RAM) – (7.5GB + 0.05 * RAM)) / 1.7
        = ((64 + 256) - (7.5 + 0.05 * 256)) / 1.7
        = 176

vm.overcommit_ratio = (RAM - (0.026 * gp_vmem)) / RAM
                    = (256 - (0.026 * 176)) / 256
                    = .982
```

You would set `vm.overcommit_ratio` of the example system to 98.

The `gp_vmem_protect_limit` calculation follows:

```shell
gp_vmem_protect_limit = gp_vmem / maximum_acting_primary_segments
                      = 176 / 11
                      = 16GB
                      = 16384MB
```

You would set the `gp_vmem_protect_limit` server configuration parameter on the example system to `16384`.
