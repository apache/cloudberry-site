# pg_resqueuecapability

:::note
The `pg_resqueuecapability` system catalog table is valid only when resource queue-based resource management is active.
:::

The `pg_resqueuecapability` system catalog table contains information about the extended attributes, or capabilities, of existing Apache Cloudberry resource queues. Only resource queues that have been assigned an extended capability, such as a priority setting, are recorded in this table. This table is joined to the [pg_resqueue](./pg-resqueue.md) table by resource queue object ID, and to the [pg_resourcetype](./pg-resourcetype.md) table by resource type ID (`restypid`).

This table is populated only on the coordinator. This table is defined in the `pg_global` tablespace, meaning it is globally shared across all databases in the system.
