## Introduction
`pg_upgrade` is a tool for upgrading PostgreSQL database clusters. It upgrades data files directly, avoiding the traditional data dump and restore process, significantly reducing upgrade time.

### Key Features
- Supports upgrading between major versions (e.g., from PostgreSQL 13 to PostgreSQL 14).
- Supports in-place upgrades and link mode upgrades.
- Preserves database cluster configurations and data integrity.

---

## Prerequisites
Before using `pg_upgrade`, ensure the following conditions are met:
1. **Version Compatibility**: The source and target clusters must be adjacent major versions (e.g., 13.x to 14.x).
2. **Data Directories**: The data directories of the source and target clusters must be in different locations.
3. **Extension Compatibility**: Ensure all installed extensions are available and compatible with the new version.
4. **Backup**: Perform a full backup of the source cluster before upgrading.
5. **Stop Services**: Both the source and target clusters must be stopped during the upgrade.

---

## Upgrade Steps
Below are the basic steps to upgrade using `pg_upgrade`:

### 1. Install the New PostgreSQL Version
Install the target version of PostgreSQL and ensure the `pg_upgrade` tool is available.

```bash
# Example: Install PostgreSQL 14
sudo apt-get install postgresql-14
```

### 2. Initialize the New Cluster
Initialize a new PostgreSQL cluster as the target cluster.

```bash
# Initialize the new cluster
/usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/initdb -D /path/to/new/data
```

### 3. Stop the Source and Target Clusters
Ensure both the source and target clusters are stopped.

```bash
# Stop the source cluster
pg_ctl -D /path/to/old/data stop

# Stop the target cluster
pg_ctl -D /path/to/new/data stop
```

### 4. Run `pg_upgrade`
Use the `pg_upgrade` tool to perform the upgrade.

```bash
# Run pg_upgrade
/usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/pg_upgrade \
  -b /usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin \  # Path to the old version's binaries
  -B /usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin \  # Path to the new version's binaries
  -d /path/to/old/data \           # Data directory of the old cluster
  -D /path/to/new/data             # Data directory of the new cluster
```

### 5. Check the Upgrade Results
After the upgrade, check the log files to ensure there are no errors.

```bash
less /path/to/new/data/pg_upgrade_server.log
```

### 6. Start the New Cluster
Start the upgraded new cluster.

```bash
pg_ctl -D /path/to/new/data start
```

---

## Upgrade Modes
`pg_upgrade` supports two upgrade modes:

### 1. **Copy Mode**
- The default mode.
- Copies data files from the old cluster to the new cluster.
- Requires additional disk space for the copy.

### 2. **Link Mode**
- Uses hard links to share data files, avoiding data duplication.
- Saves disk space but requires the source and target clusters to be on the same file system.
- Enable by adding the `--link` parameter to the `pg_upgrade` command.

```bash
pg_upgrade --link ...
```

---

## Important Notes
1. **Extension Compatibility**: Some extensions may not be compatible with the new version and may need to be updated or reinstalled manually.
2. **Configuration Files**: `pg_upgrade` does not automatically migrate configuration files (e.g., `postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf`). These must be copied manually.
3. **Permissions**: Ensure the user running `pg_upgrade` has sufficient permissions to access the source and target clusters.
4. **Testing**: Before upgrading in a production environment, test the upgrade in a staging environment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What if the upgrade fails?
- Check the log files (`pg_upgrade_server.log` and `pg_upgrade_utility.log`) for error messages.
- Restore from the backup and retry the upgrade.

### 2. How to roll back the upgrade?
- If the upgrade fails, restore the backup of the old cluster's data directory and restart the old version of PostgreSQL.

### 3. Does it support upgrading across multiple major versions?
- No. `pg_upgrade` only supports upgrading between adjacent major versions (e.g., 13.x to 14.x). To upgrade across multiple versions, perform the upgrades step-by-step.

By following the steps and notes above, you can successfully use the `pg_upgrade` tool to upgrade your PostgreSQL database cluster.

## Detailed Instructions

### 1. **Pre-Upgrade Preparation**
Before upgrading, ensure the following preparations are complete:
- Back up all data.
- Check the compatibility of all extensions.
- Ensure the source and target cluster data directories are in different locations.

### 2. **Post-Upgrade Cleanup**
After the upgrade, you can delete the old cluster's data directory to free up disk space. However, ensure the new cluster is running correctly before doing so.

```bash
# Delete the old cluster's data directory
rm -rf /path/to/old/data
```

### 3. **Log Files**
`pg_upgrade` generates the following log files:
- `pg_upgrade_server.log`: Server logs.
- `pg_upgrade_utility.log`: Tool logs.

Check these log files to confirm the success of the upgrade.

## Example

Below is a complete upgrade example:

```bash
# Stop the old cluster
pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/13/data stop

# Initialize the new cluster
/usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/initdb -D /var/lib/postgresql/14/data

# Run pg_upgrade
/usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/pg_upgrade \
  -b /usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin \
  -B /usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin \
  -d /var/lib/postgresql/13/data \
  -D /var/lib/postgresql/14/data

# Start the new cluster
pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/14/data start
```
