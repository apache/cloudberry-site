This will be a two-step process designed to be transparent and minimize disruption for our users.\\n\\n## Background: Why This Change is Necessary\\n\\nAs Apache Cloudberry (Incubating) matures, establishing a clear and independent brand identity is essential. While our project originated from Greenplum, it is now independently governed under the ASF Incubator, with a distinct development roadmap.\\n\\nThe \\"Greenplum\\" name is a registered trademark owned by Broadcom Inc.. To comply with ASF policies and avoid potential trademark confusion, the PPMC reached a consensus through the discussion that took place on the Dev@ mailing list and GitHub issues to rename legacy user-facing scripts that use the `Greenplum` name term.\\n\\n## A Phased Approach to the Transition\\n\\nTo manage this transition smoothly, we will implement the changes in two phases:\\n\\n### Phase 1: Non-Breaking Notice (Release 2.0)\\n\\nThe first step has been implemented in Pull Request [#1189](https://github.com/apache/cloudberry/pull/1189) and will be included in the upcoming Apache Cloudberry 2.0 release.\\n\\n- **What\'s Changing**: When you run `source greenplum_path.sh`, you will see a notice clarifying Apache Cloudberry\u2019s independence from Broadcom\u2019s Greenplum, like the following output:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    [gpadmin@cloudberry]$ source /usr/local/cloudberry-db/greenplum_path.sh\\n\\n    # --------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    # NOTICE from the Apache Cloudberry PPMC\\n    # --------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    # This file uses the term \'greenplum\' to maintain compatibility with\\n    # earlier versions of Apache Cloudberry, which was originally called\\n    # Greenplum. This usage does not refer to VMware Tanzu Greenplum,\\n    # nor does it imply that Apache Cloudberry (Incubating) is affiliated\\n    # with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Broadcom Inc.\\n    #\\n    # This file will be renamed in a future Apache Cloudberry release to\\n    # ensure compliance with Apache Software Foundation guidelines.\\n    # We will announce the change on the project mailing list and website.\\n    #\\n    # See: https://lists.apache.org/thread/b8o974mnnqk6zpy86dgll2pgqcvqgnwm\\n    # --------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    ```\\n\\n- **Impact**: This is a **non-breaking change**. Your scripts and workflows will continue to function as before. This step offers immediate brand clarification and serves as advance notice of the upcoming rename.\\n\\n### Phase 2: Full Rename (Targeted for Release 2.1)\\n\\nThe second step will complete the brand alignment.\\n\\n* **What\'s Changing**: We plan to formally rename `greenplum_path.sh` to `cloudberry-env.sh`. This effort may also include a broader review of related configuration scripts and internal naming for consistency.\\n* **Impact**: This will be a **breaking change**. You need to run the command `source cloudberry-env.sh` instead of `source greenplum_path.sh`. The change will be documented in the release notes, along with an optional alias method in the documentation, like: \\n\\n    ```bash \\n    sudo ln -s /usr/local/cloudberry-db/cloudberry-env.sh /usr/local/cloudberry-db/greenplum_path.sh\\n    ```\\n\\n### What This Means for You\\n\\n- **For the 2.0 Release**: No action is required. Simply be aware that the notice will now appear when setting up your environment.\\n- **For the 2.1 Release**: Plan to update your scripts to use the new `cloudberry-env.sh` file.\\n\\n## Moving Forward\\n\\nThis initiative lays a stronger foundation for the project\'s future as we continue our journey toward becoming a Top-Level Project. We thank everyone who participated in the discussion and the ASF legal team for the valuable inputs and advice.\\n\\nThank you for your support and understanding.\\n\\n## Related Discussion\\n\\n- GitHub PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudberry/pull/1189\\n- Mailing list thread: https://lists.apache.org/thread/b8o974mnnqk6zpy86dgll2pgqcvqgnwm\\n\\n## Join Us\\n\\n- Visit the website: [https://cloudberry.apache.org](https://cloudberry.apache.org)\\n- Follow us on GitHub: [https://github.com/apache/cloudberry](https://github.com/apache/cloudberry)\\n- Join Slack workspace: [https://apache-cloudberry.slack.com](https://apache-cloudberry.slack.com)\\n- Dev mailing list: to subscribe and check the archives, please visit [here](/community/mailing-lists)"},{"id":"apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-20-apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview.md","title":"Apache Cloudberry 2.0 Preview: Key Features and Improvements Ahead","description":"Key highlights of Apache Cloudberry 2.0","date":"2025-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 20, 2025","tags":[{"label":"Release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"}],"readingTime":4.215,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Apache Cloudberry","imageURL":"/img/blog/dbteam.png","key":"asfcloudberry"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead","title":"Apache Cloudberry 2.0 Preview: Key Features and Improvements Ahead","description":"Key highlights of Apache Cloudberry 2.0","authors":["asfcloudberry"],"tags":["Release"],"image":"/img/blog/202506-cloudberry2.0.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Goodbye `greenplum_path.sh`, Hello `cloudberry-env.sh`: A Phased Transition Plan","permalink":"/blog/from-greenplum-path.sh-to-cloudberry-env.sh"},"nextItem":{"title":"Apache Cloudberry Incubation Report - May 2025","permalink":"/blog/apache-cloudberry-incubation-report-202505"}},"content":"The next major release of Apache Cloudberry (Incubating)\u2014version 2.0\u2014is just around the corner. As the project\u2019s first Apache release since joining the Apache Incubator, Cloudberry 2.0 brings a host of new features, performance enhancements, and compliance improvements. While the official release is still in progress, we\u2019d like to share a preview of the most exciting changes and innovations you can expect. This overview highlights the key updates and sets the stage for the upcoming launch.\\n\\n## Key Highlights of Apache Cloudberry 2.0\\n\\n### Codebase Cleanup\\n\\nOne of the major efforts in this release was cleaning up the code repository to remove outdated and unused files. This includes legacy components such as Concourse CI configurations (`concourse/*`), `hd-ci/*`, legacy deployment directories (e.g., Vagrant and Kubernetes setups), and redundant artifacts like PyGreSQL-related files. This cleanup streamlines the codebase, making it easier for contributors to navigate and focus on meaningful development.\\n\\n### Brand Refresh\\n\\nAs part of the transition to the Apache Incubator, we\u2019ve unified branding across the project source code and website. References to legacy names like \\"Cloudberry Database\\" and \\"CloudberryDB\\" have been replaced with `Apache Cloudberry` or simply `Cloudberry`. This ensures consistency and aligns the project with Apache\u2019s branding guidelines.\\n\\n### Compliance Improvements\\n\\nTo meet Apache\u2019s licensing and compliance standards, we\u2019ve added the standard Apache License headers to all relevant newly created files by the Cloudberry community, replaced incompatible tarballs like Pylint (GPL-licensed) with Ruff (MIT-licensed), and ensured the codebase passes Apache RAT validation. \\n\\nWe\u2019ve reworded the NOTICE, LICENSE, DISCLAIMER, COPYRIGHT, and SECURITY files to reflect the new Apache Cloudberry branding and compliance requirements. All submodules and components\u2019 licenses are listed in the top-level `licenses` directory.\\n\\nOur PPMC members and committers have all signed the ICLA (Individual Contributor License Agreement) files and the Cloudberry donation corporation also signed the Software Grant Agreement (SGA) files and and has been filed with the Apache Software Foundation.\\n\\nThese changes make Cloudberry fully compliant with Apache\u2019s open-source policies, paving the way for a smooth release process.\\n\\n### Cherry-Picked Enhancements from archived Greenplum\\n\\nApache Cloudberry 2.0 incorporates hundreds of commits cherry-picked from the archived Greenplum repository. These include critical bug fixes, performance improvements, and enhancements to the ORCA query optimizer and other components. While some changes outside Cloudberry\u2019s roadmap were deprioritized, the codebase is now largely aligned with Greenplum, offering a solid foundation for future development. Community contributors are welcome to pick up tasks related to these deprioritized changes. See the [proposal](https://github.com/apache/cloudberry/discussions/675) for more details.\\n\\n### New Features and Enhancements\\n\\nThis release introduces new features and enhancements that expand Cloudberry\u2019s capabilities compared to the previous Cloudberry 1.6 release:\\n\\n* Dynamic Tables: Automatically refresh query results based on base tables, external tables, or materialized views\u2014ideal for building live analytical dashboards. See the [doc](https://cloudberry.apache.org/docs/next/performance/use-dynamic-tables) for more details.\\n* PAX: Introduces a hybrid row-column storage model that improves cache efficiency and supports both object and local file systems. See the [doc](https://cloudberry.apache.org/docs/next/operate-with-data/pax-table-format) for more details.\\n* And More: Cloudberry 2.0 brings extensive enhancements across query optimization, the ORCA optimizer, transaction management, storage, data handling, resource managment, and tools. Full details will be available in the official 2.0 release notes.\\n\\n### CICD Process\\n\\nSince entering the Apache Incubator, a strong CI/CD pipeline has been established. This pipeline covers all the core tests and checks to ensure the quality of the codebase. At the same time, it can support parallel tests to speed up the CI/CD process, and output the detailed test result parsing and reporting, etc. \\n\\nAs an Apache Incubator project, Apache Cloudberry 2.0 follows the Apache Software Foundation\u2019s release process, including community discussions, voting, and compliance checks. This ensures the release meets the standards of quality and transparency.\\n\\n### Security Enhancements\\n\\nSecurity has been a top priority for Apache Cloudberry 2.0. We\u2019ve introduced Coverity Scan and SonarQube for automated weekly code analysis, ensuring the codebase is robust and secure. \\n\\nAdditionally, we\u2019ve addressed critical vulnerabilities, including PostgreSQL CVE-2025-1049 fixes, and upgraded dependencies such as `PyYAML` to patch known issues.

On November 5th, 2024, the Cloudberry project repositories were transferred to the Apache Software Foundation. With this transition, Cloudberry has fully joined the incubator and begun its development under the Apache umbrella. Additionally, the Cloudberry Database is now proudly rebranded to Apache Cloudberry\u2122\ufe0f (Incubating).\\n\\n![Cloudberry Database enters Apache Incubator](/img/blog/cloudberry-database-enters-apache-incubator.jpeg)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What is Cloudberry\\n\\nCloudberry, created by the original developers of Greenplum Database, is an advanced and mature open-source Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) database. It evolves from the open-source version of the Pivotal Greenplum Database\xae but features a newer PostgreSQL kernel and more advanced enterprise capabilities. Cloudberry can serve as a data warehouse and can also be used for large-scale analytics and AI/ML workloads.\\n\\n![Apache Cloudberry Logo](/img/blog/apache-cloudberry-logo-color.png)\\n\\nThe Greenplum Database has been massively adopted by large numbers of small, medium, and big giant teams from different industries. It is also listed among the Top50 popular databases according to the [DB-Engines website](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking). However, with the archiving of the open-source Greenplum Database and a complete shutdown of its community, original open-source Greenplum users cannot get the security or feature updates for free anymore which results in potential challenges for their business.\\n\\nWe want to make Cloudberry the primary open-source alternative to the original Greenplum open-source version. We hope all open-source developers and users of Greenplum will migrate to Cloudberry.\\n\\n## The Story of Cloudberry\\n\\nBefore going further, we would like to recap the history of the Greenplum Database from closed-source to open-source (October 2015) and then going closed-source (May 2024):\\n\\n- The Greenplum Database has a long history back to 2003 when it was originally developed based on Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) architecture and the PostgreSQL technology by a company called Greenplum Inc.\\n- In 2010, Greenplum Inc. was acquired by EMC Corporation.\\n- In 2012, EMC and VMware (a subsidiary of EMC) combined several of their software assets, including Greenplum Database, into a new company called Pivotal Software, Inc.\\n- In 2015, Pivotal open sourced the Greenplum\u2019s core engine and rebranded it as Pivotal Greenplum Database\xae, which became the first open-source MPP data warehouse. The open-source core of the Pivotal Greenplum Database\xae was used to initiate Apache HAWQ and Apache MADlib projects, while the Greenplum itself remained a single vendor open-source project.\\n- In 2019, VMware acquired Pivotal Software. This acquisition brought the Pivotal Greenplum Database\xae back into VMware. VMware continued to support the Greenplum Database development and its open-source community and provided VMware Tanzu Greenplum as the commercial product in the following years.\\n- In November 2023, Broadcom completed its acquisition of VMware and Greenplum is under Broadcom[^2].\\n- In May 2024, nearly all Greenplum\u2019s GitHub repos were archived and became read-only, the Slack workspace was deleted (https://greenplum.slack.com), and both `user`[^3] and `dev`[^4] community email lists went silent. These are done by its latest owner without any announcements.\\n\\nYou can see that the ownership of Greenplum Database has changed many times over the past many years, which has raised concerns among the community users, developers, and ecosystem partners. Being controlled by one single vendor, Greenplum has lacked an open governance model that allows community participation in the decision-making process.\\n\\nThe Cloudberry builders recognized that the Greenplum Database had lost its drive for innovation and major feature updates for a long time. Greenplum became less competitive compared to newer generation open-source data warehouses and analytics projects.\\n\\nCloudberry was launched in 2022 by the original Greenplum developers, and its source code was made open in 2023. We were surprised when Greenplum suddenly shifted to a closed-source model, which was quite dramatic. From that point on, we were determined to continue our mission and reunite the original open-source Greenplum developers and users, shaping our project in a community way.\\n\\nCloudberry is not only simply remade with a different brand. It comes with a fantastic vision and ships a lot of advanced features and highlights, including a newer PostgreSQL kernel, enhanced security, end-to-end performance optimization, supporting AI/ML workloads and streaming, lakehouse integration, and more. We aim to keep Cloudberry compatible with Greenplum to let users use Cloudberry the way they were using Greenplum.\\n\\n## Why Apache Incubator?\\n\\nJoining the Apache Incubator is a major step for Cloudberry as it opens the door for collaboration, community growth, and innovation within the open-source world. The Apache Incubator provides a framework for the governance, mentoring, and management of open-source projects, ensuring the project\u2019s growth while aligning with the Apache Way\u2014a community-driven development model that emphasizes transparency and open collaboration.\\n\\nAs Cloudberry enters the Incubator, we are more committed than ever to fostering a vibrant, diverse developer community and encouraging contributions from across the globe. Cloudberry will now have the opportunity to benefit from the mentorship of experienced Apache community members. We hope Cloudberry can graduate from ASF Incubator and be mature and successful as a top-level Apache project by following the Apache Way.\\n\\n## Acknowledgments\\n\\nThank you to all contributors from the Cloudberry community and our upstream projects\u2019 contributors for their great contributions! Thanks to Roman Shaposhnik as our Champion, and thanks to Willem Jiang and Kent Yao as our mentors.\\n\\n## Join us\\n\\nAs Cloudberry embarks on this exciting journey within the Apache Incubator, we invite developers, data scientists, and database enthusiasts to get involved in shaping the future of the project.
