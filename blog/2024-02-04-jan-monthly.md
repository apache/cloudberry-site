Hello, welcome to the first issue of our community newsletter for 2024. In this newsletter, I'll share the latest updates on the Cloudberry Database project and the community.

## Highlights

### Cloudberry Database Roadmap 2024

We have just released the Cloudberry Database Roadmap for 2024 and you can find it on [GitHub Discussions #369](https://github.com/orgs/cloudberrydb/discussions/369). The roadmap outlines the milestones for the Cloudberry Database project in 2024, including features and enhancements, kernel updates, streaming, lakehouse, AI/ML, ecosystem, and release plan.

We would be delighted if you could join us in shaping the future of Cloudberry Database. We welcome your thoughts and ideas, so feel free to share them.

### New fresh-look Website

At the beginning of 2024, we launched our new Cloudberry Database website which has a fresh and modern design. We are confident that you will have an excellent browsing experience on the website. In case you have any suggestions, please feel free to let us know.
