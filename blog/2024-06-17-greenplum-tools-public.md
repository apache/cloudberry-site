## About Cloudberry Database


Cloudberry Database is created by the Greenplum Database developers, PostgreSQL contributors and ASF committers. We want Cloudberry Database to be the best open source alternative to Greenplum.

As a derivative of the Greenplum Database, Cloudberry Database is compatible with Greenplum. You can use Cloudberry Database the way using Greenplum. Cloudberry Database has a newer PostgreSQL 14.4 kernel and lots of advanced features Greenplum does not support, see the [full comparison](https://cloudberrydb.org/docs/cbdb-vs-gp-features).
