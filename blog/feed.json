While our project originated from Greenplum, it is now independently governed under the ASF Incubator, with a distinct development roadmap.</p>\n<p>The \"Greenplum\" name is a registered trademark owned by Broadcom Inc.. To comply with ASF policies and avoid potential trademark confusion, the PPMC reached a consensus through the discussion that took place on the Dev@ mailing list and GitHub issues to rename legacy user-facing scripts that use the <code>Greenplum</code> name term.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"a-phased-approach-to-the-transition\">A Phased Approach to the Transition<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/from-greenplum-path.sh-to-cloudberry-env.sh#a-phased-approach-to-the-transition\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to A Phased Approach to the Transition\" title=\"Direct link to A Phased Approach to the Transition\">​</a></h2>\n<p>To manage this transition smoothly, we will implement the changes in two phases:</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"phase-1-non-breaking-notice-release-20\">Phase 1: Non-Breaking Notice (Release 2.0)<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/from-greenplum-path.sh-to-cloudberry-env.sh#phase-1-non-breaking-notice-release-20\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Phase 1: Non-Breaking Notice (Release 2.0)\" title=\"Direct link to Phase 1: Non-Breaking Notice (Release 2.0)\">​</a></h3>\n<p>The first step has been implemented in Pull Request <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/cloudberry/pull/1189\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#1189</a> and will be included in the upcoming Apache Cloudberry 2.0 release.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What's Changing</strong>: When you run <code>source greenplum_path.sh</code>, you will see a notice clarifying Apache Cloudberry’s independence from Broadcom’s Greenplum, like the following output:</p>\n<div class=\"language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block\" style=\"--prism-color:#f8f8f2;--prism-background-color:#272822\"><div class=\"codeBlockContent_biex\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822\"><code class=\"codeBlockLines_e6Vv\"><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2\"><span class=\"token plain\">[gpadmin@cloudberry]$ source /usr/local/cloudberry-db/greenplum_path.sh</span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2\"><span class=\"token plain\" style=\"display:inline-block\"></span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2\"><span class=\"token plain\"># --------------------------------------------------------------------</span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2\"><span class=\"token plain\"># NOTICE from the Apache Cloudberry PPMC</span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2\"><span class=\"token plain\"># --------------------------------------------------------------------</span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2\"><span class=\"token plain\"># This file uses the term 'greenplum' to maintain compatibility with</span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2\"><span class=\"token plain\"># earlier versions of Apache Cloudberry, which was originally called</span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2\"><span class=\"token plain\"># Greenplum.

            "content_html": "<p>The next major release of Apache Cloudberry (Incubating)—version 2.0—is just around the corner. As the project’s first Apache release since joining the Apache Incubator, Cloudberry 2.0 brings a host of new features, performance enhancements, and compliance improvements. While the official release is still in progress, we’d like to share a preview of the most exciting changes and innovations you can expect. This overview highlights the key updates and sets the stage for the upcoming launch.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"key-highlights-of-apache-cloudberry-20\">Key Highlights of Apache Cloudberry 2.0<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#key-highlights-of-apache-cloudberry-20\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Key Highlights of Apache Cloudberry 2.0\" title=\"Direct link to Key Highlights of Apache Cloudberry 2.0\">​</a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"codebase-cleanup\">Codebase Cleanup<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#codebase-cleanup\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Codebase Cleanup\" title=\"Direct link to Codebase Cleanup\">​</a></h3>\n<p>One of the major efforts in this release was cleaning up the code repository to remove outdated and unused files. This includes legacy components such as Concourse CI configurations (<code>concourse/*</code>), <code>hd-ci/*</code>, legacy deployment directories (e.g., Vagrant and Kubernetes setups), and redundant artifacts like PyGreSQL-related files. This cleanup streamlines the codebase, making it easier for contributors to navigate and focus on meaningful development.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"brand-refresh\">Brand Refresh<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#brand-refresh\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Brand Refresh\" title=\"Direct link to Brand Refresh\">​</a></h3>\n<p>As part of the transition to the Apache Incubator, we’ve unified branding across the project source code and website. References to legacy names like \"Cloudberry Database\" and \"CloudberryDB\" have been replaced with <code>Apache Cloudberry</code> or simply <code>Cloudberry</code>. This ensures consistency and aligns the project with Apache’s branding guidelines.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"compliance-improvements\">Compliance Improvements<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#compliance-improvements\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Compliance Improvements\" title=\"Direct link to Compliance Improvements\">​</a></h3>\n<p>To meet Apache’s licensing and compliance standards, we’ve added the standard Apache License headers to all relevant newly created files by the Cloudberry community, replaced incompatible tarballs like Pylint (GPL-licensed) with Ruff (MIT-licensed), and ensured the codebase passes Apache RAT validation.</p>\n<p>We’ve reworded the NOTICE, LICENSE, DISCLAIMER, COPYRIGHT, and SECURITY files to reflect the new Apache Cloudberry branding and compliance requirements. All submodules and components’ licenses are listed in the top-level <code>licenses</code> directory.</p>\n<p>Our PPMC members and committers have all signed the ICLA (Individual Contributor License Agreement) files and the Cloudberry donation corporation also signed the Software Grant Agreement (SGA) files and and has been filed with the Apache Software Foundation.</p>\n<p>These changes make Cloudberry fully compliant with Apache’s open-source policies, paving the way for a smooth release process.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"cherry-picked-enhancements-from-archived-greenplum\">Cherry-Picked Enhancements from archived Greenplum<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#cherry-picked-enhancements-from-archived-greenplum\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Cherry-Picked Enhancements from archived Greenplum\" title=\"Direct link to Cherry-Picked Enhancements from archived Greenplum\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Apache Cloudberry 2.0 incorporates hundreds of commits cherry-picked from the archived Greenplum repository. These include critical bug fixes, performance improvements, and enhancements to the ORCA query optimizer and other components. While some changes outside Cloudberry’s roadmap were deprioritized, the codebase is now largely aligned with Greenplum, offering a solid foundation for future development. Community contributors are welcome to pick up tasks related to these deprioritized changes. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/cloudberry/discussions/675\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">proposal</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"new-features-and-enhancements\">New Features and Enhancements<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#new-features-and-enhancements\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to New Features and Enhancements\" title=\"Direct link to New Features and Enhancements\">​</a></h3>\n<p>This release introduces new features and enhancements that expand Cloudberry’s capabilities compared to the previous Cloudberry 1.6 release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamic Tables: Automatically refresh query results based on base tables, external tables, or materialized views—ideal for building live analytical dashboards. See the <a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/docs/next/performance/use-dynamic-tables\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doc</a> for more details.</li>\n<li>PAX: Introduces a hybrid row-column storage model that improves cache efficiency and supports both object and local file systems. See the <a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/docs/next/operate-with-data/pax-table-format\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doc</a> for more details.</li>\n<li>And More: Cloudberry 2.0 brings extensive enhancements across query optimization, the ORCA optimizer, transaction management, storage, data handling, resource managment, and tools. Full details will be available in the official 2.0 release notes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"cicd-process\">CICD Process<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#cicd-process\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to CICD Process\" title=\"Direct link to CICD Process\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Since entering the Apache Incubator, a strong CI/CD pipeline has been established. This pipeline covers all the core tests and checks to ensure the quality of the codebase. At the same time, it can support parallel tests to speed up the CI/CD process, and output the detailed test result parsing and reporting, etc.</p>\n<p>As an Apache Incubator project, Apache Cloudberry 2.0 follows the Apache Software Foundation’s release process, including community discussions, voting, and compliance checks. This ensures the release meets the standards of quality and transparency.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"security-enhancements\">Security Enhancements<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#security-enhancements\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Security Enhancements\" title=\"Direct link to Security Enhancements\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Security has been a top priority for Apache Cloudberry 2.0. We’ve introduced Coverity Scan and SonarQube for automated weekly code analysis, ensuring the codebase is robust and secure.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we’ve addressed critical vulnerabilities, including PostgreSQL CVE-2025-1049 fixes, and upgraded dependencies such as <code>PyYAML</code> to patch known issues. These measures reinforce Cloudberry’s commitment to providing a secure and reliable database platform.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"website-and-docs-updates\">Website and Docs updates<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#website-and-docs-updates\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Website and Docs updates\" title=\"Direct link to Website and Docs updates\">​</a></h3>\n<p>The website and documentation have been updated to reflect the new branding and features. The website now includes a new design, updated content, and better navigation. The documentation has been updated to reflect the new features and changes in the codebase.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking Ahead<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/apache-cloudberry-2.0-preview-key-features-and-improvements-ahead#looking-ahead\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Looking Ahead\" title=\"Direct link to Looking Ahead\">​</a></h2>\n<p>As an Apache Incubator project, Cloudberry 2.0 follows the ASF’s rigorous release process, including open discussion, voting, and compliance checks. This ensures transparency, quality, and community trust.</p>\n<p>With a cleaner codebase, enhanced security, and exciting new features and enhancements, Apache Cloudberry 2.0 will be a major milestone that sets the stage for future innovation. We invite the community to join us in shaping the future of Apache Cloudberry by contributing, testing, and sharing feedback.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for the official 2.0 release announcement!

However, with the archiving of the open-source Greenplum Database and a complete shutdown of its community, original open-source Greenplum users cannot get the security or feature updates for free anymore which results in potential challenges for their business.</p>\n<p>We want to make Cloudberry the primary open-source alternative to the original Greenplum open-source version. We hope all open-source developers and users of Greenplum will migrate to Cloudberry.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"the-story-of-cloudberry\">The Story of Cloudberry<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/cloudberry-database-enters-the-apache-incubator#the-story-of-cloudberry\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to The Story of Cloudberry\" title=\"Direct link to The Story of Cloudberry\">​</a></h2>\n<p>Before going further, we would like to recap the history of the Greenplum Database from closed-source to open-source (October 2015) and then going closed-source (May 2024):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Greenplum Database has a long history back to 2003 when it was originally developed based on Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) architecture and the PostgreSQL technology by a company called Greenplum Inc.</li>\n<li>In 2010, Greenplum Inc. was acquired by EMC Corporation.</li>\n<li>In 2012, EMC and VMware (a subsidiary of EMC) combined several of their software assets, including Greenplum Database, into a new company called Pivotal Software, Inc.</li>\n<li>In 2015, Pivotal open sourced the Greenplum’s core engine and rebranded it as Pivotal Greenplum Database®, which became the first open-source MPP data warehouse. The open-source core of the Pivotal Greenplum Database® was used to initiate Apache HAWQ and Apache MADlib projects, while the Greenplum itself remained a single vendor open-source project.</li>\n<li>In 2019, VMware acquired Pivotal Software. This acquisition brought the Pivotal Greenplum Database® back into VMware. VMware continued to support the Greenplum Database development and its open-source community and provided VMware Tanzu Greenplum as the commercial product in the following years.</li>\n<li>In November 2023, Broadcom completed its acquisition of VMware and Greenplum is under Broadcom<sup><a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/cloudberry-database-enters-the-apache-incubator#user-content-fn-2-347664\" id=\"user-content-fnref-2-347664\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">2</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>In May 2024, nearly all Greenplum’s GitHub repos were archived and became read-only, the Slack workspace was deleted (<a href=\"https://greenplum.slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://greenplum.slack.com</a>), and both <code>user</code><sup><a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/cloudberry-database-enters-the-apache-incubator#user-content-fn-3-347664\" id=\"user-content-fnref-3-347664\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">3</a></sup> and <code>dev</code><sup><a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/cloudberry-database-enters-the-apache-incubator#user-content-fn-4-347664\" id=\"user-content-fnref-4-347664\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">4</a></sup> community email lists went silent. These are done by its latest owner without any announcements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see that the ownership of Greenplum Database has changed many times over the past many years, which has raised concerns among the community users, developers, and ecosystem partners. Being controlled by one single vendor, Greenplum has lacked an open governance model that allows community participation in the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>The Cloudberry builders recognized that the Greenplum Database had lost its drive for innovation and major feature updates for a long time. Greenplum became less competitive compared to newer generation open-source data warehouses and analytics projects.</p>\n<p>Cloudberry was launched in 2022 by the original Greenplum developers, and its source code was made open in 2023. We were surprised when Greenplum suddenly shifted to a closed-source model, which was quite dramatic. From that point on, we were determined to continue our mission and reunite the original open-source Greenplum developers and users, shaping our project in a community way.</p>\n<p>Cloudberry is not only simply remade with a different brand. It comes with a fantastic vision and ships a lot of advanced features and highlights, including a newer PostgreSQL kernel, enhanced security, end-to-end performance optimization, supporting AI/ML workloads and streaming, lakehouse integration, and more. We aim to keep Cloudberry compatible with Greenplum to let users use Cloudberry the way they were using Greenplum.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"why-apache-incubator\">Why Apache Incubator?<a href=\"https://cloudberry.apache.org/blog/cloudberry-database-enters-the-apache-incubator#why-apache-incubator\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Why Apache Incubator?\" title=\"Direct link to Why Apache Incubator?\">​</a></h2>\n<p>Joining the Apache Incubator is a major step for Cloudberry as it opens the door for collaboration, community growth, and innovation within the open-source world. The Apache Incubator provides a framework for the governance, mentoring, and management of open-source projects, ensuring the project’s growth while aligning with the Apache Way—a community-driven development model that emphasizes transparency and open collaboration.</p>\n<p>As Cloudberry enters the Incubator, we are more committed than ever to fostering a vibrant, diverse developer community and encouraging contributions from across the globe. Cloudberry will now have the opportunity to benefit from the mentorship of experienced Apache community members.
