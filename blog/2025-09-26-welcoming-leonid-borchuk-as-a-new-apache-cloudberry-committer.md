We're thrilled to announce that Leonid Borchuk (GitHub ID: leborchuk) has joined Apache Cloudberry as our newest committer! ðŸŽ‰

<!-- truncate -->

The Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC) for Apache Cloudberry has invited Leonid Borchuk to become a committer, and we are pleased to announce that he has accepted.

Leonid has been an active contributor to the Apache Cloudberry project since October 2024. He has demonstrated consistent engagement and technical expertise across multiple areas, including cherry-picking commits from Greenplum to Cloudberry, reviewing PRs and providing valuable feedback to other contributors, participating in roadmap discussions, and contributing innovative ideas. He has been instrumental in renaming greenplum_path.sh to cloudberry-env.sh.

He also helped migrate the cloudberry-devops-release repo to the main repo and implemented Ubuntu support workflow for CI/CD. These efforts have brought significant improvements to our infrastructure.

Becoming a committer recognizes both Leonid's past contributions and the community's trust in his continued involvement. Committers play a vital role in shaping the project by reviewing and merging contributions, participating in design decisions, and helping guide the project's growth.

Please join us in congratulating Leonid Borchuk on this well-deserved recognition. We look forward to his continued contributions and collaboration within the Apache Cloudberry community!
