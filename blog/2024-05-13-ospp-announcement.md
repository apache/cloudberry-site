## What's OSPP?

The Open Source Promotion Program (OSPP), which is initiated by the Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences, is a summer event that encourages university students to participate in the development of open-source software.

Much like Google Summer of Code, OSPP provides an opportunity for students to get involved and contribute to the open-source community.

## What’s Cloudberry Database

Cloudberry Database is created by one team of original Greenplum Database developers and ASF committers. We aim to bring modern computing capabilities to the traditional distributed MPP database to support Analytics and AI/ML workloads in one platform.

As a derivative of Greenplum Database 7, Cloudberry Database is compatible with Greenplum Database, but it's shipped with a newer PostgreSQL 14.4 kernel (scheduled kernel upgrade yearly), and a bunch of features Greenplum Database lacks or does not support. View the [Cloudberry Database vs Greenplum Database](https://cloudberrydb.org/docs/cbdb-vs-gp-features) doc for details.
