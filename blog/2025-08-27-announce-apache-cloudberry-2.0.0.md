The Apache Cloudberry (Incubating) community is pleased to announce the release of Apache Cloudberry (Incubating) version 2.0.0, the project’s first official release under the Apache Software Foundation.

Apache Cloudberry (Incubating) is a Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) database for large-scale data analytics, derived from PostgreSQL and the last open-source version of Greenplum Database. It is designed to support both on-premise and cloud deployments, providing a scalable foundation for data warehousing and advanced analytics.

We’d like to express our gratitude to all contributors to this release, as well as to the mentors and the Apache Incubator community for their invaluable support. This milestone reflects a collaborative effort to meet ASF release requirements and establish Cloudberry as an open and community-driven project.

Disclaimer:
Apache Cloudberry is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a review by the Incubator PMC demonstrates that the project has met the ASF’s requirements for community and process. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the project’s stability or readiness for production, it does indicate that the project is working towards compliance with ASF processes and governance.
